# Capstone-Project
EPFL data science &amp; ML course

Overview of the Capstone Project process
The capstone project is the final assessment of this program. We will use it to evaluate your skills and your understanding of different topics and methods in data science that you acquired throughout this program.

The capstone project consists of three phases:

The project proposal
The project implementation
The capstone defense
We will start with an overview of the requirements before giving a short overview over the three phases mentioned above. That way you know what to expect and what to prepare. Note that you will get more detailed information about writing your project proposal and the submission of your capstone project in the following units.

Capstone project requirements
Let us start with an overview of the requirements for the capstone project. This final project will assess whether you have successfully acquired the relevant skills and knowledge presented in this program and hence successfully met the learning objectives of the program. They include

Data Preparation
Collect and import the required datasets
Demonstrate good understanding of the data and its structure (values, encoding, format, etc.)
Prepare the data appropriately for the analysis and modeling (data cleaning, errors and inconsistencies, missing values, etc)
Exploratory Data Analysis
Demonstrate a deep understanding of the data specific to the project goals by performing detailed exploratory data analysis including all necessary descriptive statistics and visualization methods
Discuss insights and potential difficulties to justify the proposed implementation
Discuss data quality and completeness with respect to the intended project goals
Discuss potential data preparations for modeling purpose (feature engineering and encoding)
Machine Learning Models
Identify and discuss suitable machine learning models, baselines, metrics and evaluation strategies
Tune the different models, analyze their performance
Discuss the results and potential trade-offs (complexity, interpretability, computational resources) using the appropriate terminology
Communication
Use data to tell a story and discuss the value of the results. Highlight interesting insights through discussion and visualizations
Document and discuss each step of the analysis to support approaches and their implementation
Present and evaluate findings, discuss results in the context of the project goals
The project proposal (overview)
The first step will be to come up with a real-world problem of your own choice, find suitable data and then write up and submit a proposal via the platform. In the next unit you will find more details on what to include in the proposal.

Since your overall goal is to showcase the knowledge and skills that you have developed throughout the four courses of this program, you should aim to create a project that provides plenty of opportunities to do so.

At the same time, we encourage you to choose something that truly interests you or may benefit you in your work place. Afterall motivation is key when working on a bigger project.

If you are stuck for ideas, we provide a list of some public datasets at the end of the next unit. It may provide some inspiration. If you already have an idea but are unsure about its suitability don’t hesitate to reach out to us in a 1-1 to check that it fits the project requirements and that the proposal document is detailed enough. Finalizing the proposal can often require multiple submissions. So don’t worry if we return the proposal with a request for modifications

Typically one of us will act as your mentor and point of contact for the whole capstone process. They will make sure your proposal meets all requirements and contains sufficient opportunities to demonstrate your skill set. They will also review the final submission and guide the defense session.

The project implementation and submission (overview)
Once your proposal has been reviewed and accepted by our team you work on the capstone project and focus on the implementation itself. Note that you can directly integrate the work from your project proposal directly into the final project. You should keep mind that the final project must be a stand alone submission that contains all relevant parts without reference to the proposal.

The final project will be a well-documented and well-structured Jupyter notebook containing all your discussions, analyses and models and telling the story of your project. You should ensure that you showcase your data science knowledge and skills as outlined in detail in your proposal and that you meet all the relevant requirement for the capstone project.

Note that we cannot provide direct help (code related, debugging, problem solving, completeness) during the implementation as this is your final graded project. Nevertheless don’t be afraid to reach out to us about conceptual questions.

Once you have completed your capstone project you can submit it via the platform. Note that you can only submit your final capstone project once, so make sure it’s ready: i.e. well-executed, well-documented and demonstrating all your skills!

The capstone defense
Once submitted, your mentor will review your final capstone project. This review can take around 2 weeks, so please take this into account in your planning. Feel free to reach out if you foresee any issues regarding the timing of the defense.

Once your capstone project has been reviewed your mentor will send you a link to book a 1-1 for the defense. The capstone defense will be hosted by your mentor and joined by another team member, who has not seen your project before.

In the first part of the capstone defense, you will be given 30 minutes to present your project, its key methods, and the main results. From experience, it is best to use slides for this part, but you can also refer to your notebooks if needed. Since the second assessor won’t have seen your project, you should keep this in mind during your presentation.

The presentation will be followed by questions and more detailed discussions of your approaches and notebooks with our team. You should be able to explain your work as well as the concepts, methods and models employed in your project (e.g., feature extraction, model selection, parameter tuning, data handling, …). You can check the course summaries at the end of course 3 and 4 to remind yourself of the key concepts and learning objectives from both courses.
